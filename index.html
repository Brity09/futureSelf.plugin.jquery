	<h2>What is futureSelf?</h2>
	<p>futureSelf is a JQuery plug in for implementing a countdown timer solution to any site. Ideally used for events, business launches, or fundraising campaigns or crowdfunding sites.</p>
	<p>The idea behind futureSelf is based off of a new study in psychological science by Neil A. Lewis Jr and Daphna Oyserman from the University of Michigan and the University of Southern California respectively. The study is based on the theory that people assume that they should tend to their present selves and their future selves can handle the future. This theory can lead to the harmful behaviour of procrastination due to lack of motivation for current action. To create a sense of imminance, if you manipulate the time metric in which time is considered (example: days vs years). We interprit these metrics for implying when preperation should start. (e.g., planning to start saving 4 times sooner for a retirement in 10,950 days instead of 30 years). Time metrics mattered not because they changed how distal or important future events felt, but because they changed how connected and congruent their current and future selves felt.</p>
